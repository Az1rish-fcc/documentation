                <p>There really won't be much thought put onto the text of this website. My main focus in creating it is as an example of a technical documentation page. It will mainly be gibberish and lorem ipsum.</p>
                <p>The section titles were taken directly from the first five section titles in the example. If you are interested in the subject matter I would direct you to the example, as it wasn't more informative than this will be. Thanks for reading anyway.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="what_you_should_already_know">
                <header>What you should already know</header>
                <p>If you want to learn Javascript you should already have a firm grasp on these things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How the internet works</li>
                    <li>html</li>
                    <li>css</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After you have a good handle on those things, Javascript will be your first step into actual programming (as opposed to marking up the page).</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java">
                <header>Javascript and Java</header>
                <p>Javascript and Java are both programming languages. They have some similarities but are actually quite different.</p>
                <p>They used to be different things.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Javascript used to be called Livescript</li>
                    <li>Java used to be an island known for coffee and tigers (maybe?).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
                <header>Hello World</header>
                <p>Hellow World in html might look something like this:</p>
                <code>&lth1&gtHello world&lt/h1&gt</code>
                <p>in Javascript it might look like this:</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {<br>
                alert("Hello " + yourName);<br>
                }<br>
                greetMe("World");</code>
            </section><br>
            <section class="main-section" id="variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>Variables are names you make up to represent values in you application.</p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <code>let i = 4</code><br>
                <code>var tim = "john"</code><br>
                <code>let me = you</code>
